	\begin{comment}
		Each team is required to provide a Requirements Analysis Report. This will document your teams understanding of the specification, and will raise any questions that you may have. As well as addressing the specification itself, the report should also document any decisions that have been made in terms of group management (i.e. how you have organized yourselves to meet the goals of this project, how often you will meet, how you will address decision making etc.) and what methods you intend using in the planning and design of your solution.
		
		The requirements analysis report is not a design document, but rather a means by which you can demonstrate your understanding of the projectâ€™s aims. Any queries that you have regarding the specification should be clearly stated in this report.
		
		This part of your first deliverable must not exceed four sides of A4. Any appendices or other attachments will be removed.
